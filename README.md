Virtual Reality Project 01
Google VR SDK V1.0

Summary:
This project was definitely challenging as I had initially built it in Unity 5.6 but was unable to run it on the phone, However after discussing in the Forum I tried to rebuild it in Unity 5.5.1 but ran into many issues. Finally I went back into Unity 5.6 and it worked after weeks of struggle but completely worth it. As I got to learn so much about Unity during the troubleshooting process. :-)
